# ink4-migration
This repository aims to fill in the gaps in documentation and guides for developers wanting to migrated their contracts and frontends to the new ink4.

We will start with separate files for:
* plain ink4 contracts - [contracts.md](./contracts.md)
* OpenBrush contracts - [openbrush.md](./openbrush.md)
* frontend - [frontend.md](./frontend.md)
