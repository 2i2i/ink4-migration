# ink4-migration
This repository aims to fill in the gaps in documentation and guides for developers wanting to migrated their contracts and frontends to the new ink4.

We will start with separate files for:
* plain ink4 contracts - [contracts.md](./contracts.md)
* OpenBrush contracts - [openbrush.md](./openbrush.md)
* frontend (usage of polkadot-js/api or similar) - [frontend.md](./frontend.md)
* tooling (`cargo contract`, etc.) - [tools.md](./tools.md)

# How to suggest changes to the content

If you wish to add/change content to the guide (and we very much encourage you to do so!), you can do that directly from the GitHub service:
* Go to the page you want to edit (frontend, contracts, openbrush)
* Click on **Edit this file** (keyboard shortcut is uppercase E) in the upper-right corner:

* When you're ready to create a PR just fill in the title, short description and **Propose changes**:

We hope that this documentation will grow as more people will contribute to it, working together towards the same goal.

Happy hacking and looking forward to working with you,
Aleph Zero team
